- I like to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) its free and works great. 
# Learn javascript
- watch videos on [pluralsight.com]
 - I prefer the [videos](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-programming-basics) and books of [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) or [Scott Allen](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learning-programming-javascript)
 - try to do as much handson via codeschool/codeAcademy
 - read `javascript - the good parts` (most other books are way to complex)
 - focus on the following topics
 - variables and functions
 - scope
 - asynchronous code (callback functions, promises, async/await)
 - ES6 (modules)

# learn angular 1
- Qlik Sense uses Angular 1.5

# try to make your first mashups via the dev-hub
- in the [integation.qlik.com/slides] select `deep dive` and `web` and `exercises`.
- Study the videos and content
- first try IFrame integration
- then create a mashup (see the `web` area in this slide generator. Study the generated HTML, JS and CSS. 

# learn node/Meteor.js
- Now you need to learn to run your own server. (nodeJS)
- MeteorJS handles a lot of stuff for you, so a good tool to learn. 
- Under the hood it will start NodeJS and MongoDb (the database) for you.
- [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
- Create your first TODO app with MeteorJS [here](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/angular/creating-an-app)",,"","","","","         0","0","PreSales",

"Web integration","Performance tips","9/10 times any performance issues within the Capabilities API is due to the developer not cleaning up after a `getObject` call",,,,,,,,,
"Web integration","Performance tips","```javascript
let vis = qlik.app.visualization.get('id')

vis.then(model => {
  // display chart
  model.show('someid')
})

vis.then(model => {
  // When done with the viz, clean it up from scope.
  model.close()
})
```",,,,,,,,,
"Web integration","Performance tips","When you call `close` all scopes will be destroyed and if it still has a DOM reference that node will be removed from the page.

So if the function that you shared is called every time they flip between the panels in the end you will have a lot of active visualization models.

Which all will react to every selection you make in the app and start fetching data even though they aren't rendering anything to the screen.

That's usually the main culprit when people experience that the app gets slow over time. (Source: Alexander Karlsson)",,,,,,,,,
"Web integration","Performance tips","Bundle size: `require.js` is always needed, `single.js` is the entry point for the Single Integration API and `qlik.js` is the entry point for the Capabilities API. You would normally not load both the latter ones at the same time though.",,,,,,,,,

"QRS (QMC) API","Exercise: Connect to QRS API using Postman","- Postman is a Google Chrome App for constructing and sending REST requests. You can use Postman to explore the Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS) API. (see [help](http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/June2017/Subsystems/RepositoryServiceAPI/Content/RepositoryServiceAPI/RepositoryServiceAPI-Example-Connect-Postman.htm)

- This example shows how to connect to the QRS API and retrieve a list of apps in JSON format. Because we are using Windows authentication, we send the request via the QPS URL.

1 Install Postman from http://www.getpostman.com/ and start the tool.
1 Set the HTTP method to GET.
1 Enter the URL to the computer where QPS is installed plus the following path in the URL area: `/qrs/app/full`
1 The full URL should look something like: https://qps.computer.name.com/qrs/app/full.
1 Select Params and add an entry for the Xrfkey parameter and a 16 character string as the value.
1 Select Headers and add an entry for the X-Qlik-Xrfkey header using the same 16 character string as in the previous step.
1 Click Send.
1 The JSON response from the API is displayed. It should look something like this:

"QPS - Proxy API","Use ticketing without the extra redirect","Its possible to directly pass on a ticket the first time you make a call to a static asset in Qlik Sense. See the comment from Alex below
- if you do ticketing how it works is that you get a ticket from your auth module and then you fetch a static resource from behind the proxy such as the require.js file with `qlikTicket=<ticket value>` appended to the url. The proxy will see the ticket, validate it and consume the ticket and if it's a valid ticket it will send the resource back to the browser with a session cookie attached to the response. The browser will then append the session cookie to future requests and the proxy will see the session cookie and let the requests through",,,,,,,,,
