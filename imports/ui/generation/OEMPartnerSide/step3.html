                <h4>Manual activities</h4>
                <p>This demo platform provides you with a wrapper around the Qlik Sense <a href="https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/3.1/Content/Videos/Videos-qmc-intro.htm">QMC</a>, so you can send API calls to Qlik Sense by pressing certain buttons. Using these calls you can, for example, create streams and apps or complete any other activity that youâ€™d be able to do in the QMC or app. Each activity you do is <a href="{{pathFor 'ApiLogsTable'}}" class="item">logged</a>. In these logs you can see the request from this demo platform and the responses from Qlik Sense. For example you can press
                    <ul>
                        <li>"create stream" next to the customer to create a stream.</li>
                        <li>"Copy app" to manually copy the app for each selected customer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- Why do you have to select a customer first? Well, in your SaaS platform you probably want to publish the apps only for customers who pay or who have activited the app in your software, so this "selection" simulates that use case. -->
