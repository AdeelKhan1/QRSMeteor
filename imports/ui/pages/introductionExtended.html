                    <h4> The power of the Qlik Sense API's</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Please see the video below for an introduction to this Node.js and MongoDB based Qlik Sense SaaS multi-tenant demo platform. This demo is meant to show you how you can steer and control Qlik Sense out of your software. Off course you can always use our Qlik management console to do your IT management activities by hand, but we think automation is always better... BTW do you already you know can just record the manual activity you do? E.g. you can copy an app in the QMC, and use the Chrome developer tool (F12) to record this step. You can then just copy paste the REST API call in you software...</li>
                    <li>We will start with an introduction to Qlik Sense, what is a dashboard/app/QVF file? </li>
                    <li>Then we will quickly show you our 100% web based architecture, in which both development as well as consuming the content can be done using your mobile device! No more fat clients to maintain and update</li>
                    <li>Then we will guide and show you this demo tool works, which buttons to push so you can start generating stuff in Qlik Sense. All done remotely without touching the Qlik Sense management console (QMC) but instead by using this remote (non Qlik) Meteor.JS application </li>
