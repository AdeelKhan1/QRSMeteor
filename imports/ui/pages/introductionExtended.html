                    <li>We will start with an introduction to Qlik Sense, what is a dashboard/app/QVF file? </li>
                    <li>Then we will quickly show you our 100% web based architecture, in which both development as well as consuming the content can be done using your mobile device! No more fat clients to maintain and update</li>
                    <li>Then we will guide and show you this demo tool works, which buttons to push so you can start generating stuff in Qlik Sense. All done remotely without touching the Qlik Sense management console (QMC) but instead by using this remote (non Qlik) Meteor.JS application </li>
