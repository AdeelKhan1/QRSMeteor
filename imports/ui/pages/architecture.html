    <p> The integration of two software platforms entails multiple considerations. Each platform has its own nuances. In our approach here , we deconstruct our integration approach into the following categories: dashboard, data, security, web, APIs and architecture.</p>

                <h5>Web integration</h5> In the picture below you will find all integration aspects together in 1 overview for a typical OEM architecture, in which we have
                <ul>
                    <li>Your SaaS platform's server</li>
                    <li>Qlik Sense server</li>
                    <li>A database per customer</li>
                    <li>A master configuration database</li>
                    <li>Your current API "broker"</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="ui divider"></div>
                <h5>Data integration</h5>
                <p>A powerful data integration capability for cleansing, transforming, and unifying multiple, disparate data sources for analysis. A robust data integration layer creates a unified view of information from many different sources, without requiring external tools or data repositories.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weâ€™ve assumed you have a database per customer instance and you also have a master database which contains the customers, the database connections, user rights and possibly customer specific custom tables and fields.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="ui divider"></div>
                <h5>Security integration</h5>
                <p>Actually you don't need to do so much on the security side. You don't create users or groups in Sense. You just supply the userID and group membership in the security ticket. Based on the info in the ticket access is provided.</p>
                <div class="ui divider"></div>
                <h5>Process integration</h5>
                <p>In the demo you will see the broker in action. But what are the activities that the SaaS broker automates in the demo? What are the steps or stages?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First it will create a stream for each customer. </li>
                    <li>Secondly it will copy the template app. </li>
                    <li>Next it replaces the script with a customer-specific one, or in most cases you just have to replace the database connection.</li>
                    <li>Using the new script, the app is reloaded. You can also use this mechanism to query big data sources like MongoDB. This is where we basically make a compressed copy of the data and create the associative model.</li>
                    <li>In the final stage we publish the app in the stream with the name of the customer.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
