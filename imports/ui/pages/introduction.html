                    <p>This <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a> based <a href="https://github.com/QHose/QRSMeteor">demo platform</a> has been designed to demonstrate the power of the Qlik Sense API's for companies that are looking to integrate Qlik Sense in their multi-tenant SaaS platform. Please look at the video's below for an introduction. In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts. Please note that this is a community effort has no relationship to Qlik.com</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The left side shows "the broker" in your SaaS platform; a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).
                        </li>
                        <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker; the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> This demo guides you on how you can automate each manual step in Qlik Sense. Sense works internally with the same API's as you can use, so you can record the REST call from each manual activity in the QMC and use this code to create/delete/reload/publish streams and apps in your software. We will not cover all the use cases, lets say we cover 80%, but the examples and code provided should give you enough convidence to build the remaining 20% yourself.</p>

                    <h3 class="ui header">How to use the demo?</h3>
                    <p> The principle is very simple. This demo shows you how you can copy an app (dashboard) for each of your customers. Next to creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customers database (by replacing the SQL based load script). Because you can insert a custom script you can also specify customer specific data models like "free fields and tables". In the end we make a stream (a way of grouping apps) per customer and publish the app into this stream. The demo consists of 4 steps.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You first have to enter some customers</li>
                        <li>Select the "my first template" app on the right of the screen (this is the Qlik Sense side)</li>
                        <li>Press generate</li>
                        <li>Select a user, and test the single sing on.</li>

                        <p>We integrate complete our hub, apps, sheets or individual objects using an Iframe or Div tag. All Sense functionality "is delivered via a webserver", called the proxy (QPS). This is nice because it means everything in Sense is web technology based; web sockets, javascript, CSS3, HTML5 and Angular.</p>
                        <h3 class="ui header">Your software controls Qlik Sense</h3>
                        <p>Using our .NET API, a Visual Studio plugin, javascript and REST API's you can automate everything. So your software can control and configure Sense. Using this mechanism you can for example create apps with specific (big)data on demand for each customer. You can even create complete dashboards or individual charts on the fly. This removes the need to design everything up front.</p>

                        <h4 class="ui header">Authentication - Single Sign on using tickets (tokens)</h4> We re-use your existing way to authenticate the users. We will insert a little piece of code inside your existing "security module". In this module you already know who the user is (authentication) and what his rights are (authorization). The only thing we need to do is create a trust relationship between your server and the new Qlik Sense server (via a SSL certificate exchange). And send this info about the user (userId, group membership) in a JSON object to Sense (we call this ticketing).
                        <h4 class="ui header">Authorization</h4> Based on the userId and group membership streams (a way to group apps, like HR/Finance), apps, sheets (all called "resources" in our rule based security model) are shown or not. Let's say we start simple and each customer can only view their own dashboards. Since we gave each customer its own stream we can grant access if the name of the stream (your company name) equals the the name of the company we received from your website in the ticket. We can all control this by adding 1 row of security configuraton: User.group = Stream.name.
