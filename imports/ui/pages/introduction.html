                        <p>We integrate complete our hub, apps, sheets or individual objects using an Iframe or Div tag. All Sense functionality "is delivered via a webserver", called the proxy (QPS). This is nice because it means everything in Sense is web technology based; web sockets, javascript, CSS3, HTML5 and Angular.</p>
                        <h3 class="ui header">Your software controls Qlik Sense</h3>
                        <p>Using our .NET API, a Visual Studio plugin, javascript and REST API's you can automate everything. So your software can control and configure Sense. Using this mechanism you can for example create apps with specific (big)data on demand for each customer. You can even create complete dashboards or individual charts on the fly. This removes the need to design everything up front.</p>

                            <p>The things you might see</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>See the whole story in your data. Simply because we load <b>all</b> of the fields and tables. And we connect all the data that is related to each other. We call this an associative database. You will model the data only once, and then users can choose any field they like.</li>
                                <li>Users can add extra data to the model you give them to start with. Qlik will help the user find the correct match to the existing model. We call this visual data modelling. </li>
                                <li>Qlik sense is both a visualization tool as well as a super fast in memory data warehouse. This means you can do all things you are used too in your current data warehouse. Like combining multiple data sources into one model</li>
                                <li>For super fast design you can use our of the box Qlik Sense charts</li>
                                <li>Or you can insert new charts like the javascript you already have, or you downloaded it from <a href="http://branch.qlik.com" target="_blank"> Qlik Branch </a> or <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery" target="_blank">the D3 chart library </a>. These are also fully interactive with the Sense Charts. We call this concept "extensions"</li>
                                <li>An API tool that creates apps for each customer using the Qlik Sense REST API's</li>
                                <li>Let end users extend the content you deliver. You will give them a starting template with 80% of the functionality and let the users create the remaining 20%</li>
                                <li>
                                    This will save you 80% of the time you now spend on reports that are "never close to what the customer wanted..."

                        <h4 class="ui header">Authentication - Single Sign on using tickets (tokens)</h4> We re-use your existing way to authenticate the users. We will insert a little piece of code inside your existing "security module". In this module you already know who the user is (authentication) and what his rights are (authorization). The only thing we need to do is create a trust relationship between your server and the new Qlik Sense server (via a SSL certificate exchange). And send this info about the user (userId, group membership) in a JSON object to Sense (we call this ticketing).
                        <h4 class="ui header">Authorization</h4> Based on the userId and group membership streams (a way to group apps, like HR/Finance), apps, sheets (all called "resources" in our rule based security model) are shown or not. Let's say we start simple and each customer can only view their own dashboards. Since we gave each customer its own stream we can grant access if the name of the stream (your company name) equals the the name of the company we received from your website in the ticket. We can all control this by adding 1 row of security configuraton: User.group = Stream.name.
