                                APIs are our secret sauce and the website we will explore today is specifically designed to illustrate the unique selling points of our Qlik Sense APIs. The objective of this presentation is to simplify and explain the power of the Qlik Sense APIs in a language that can be easily understood by non-technical business users or decision-makers through a ‘sample’ step-by-step walk-through. We developed this learning environment from our experiences with AFAS, as well as other key customer accounts. The objective of this approach is to explain, excite and reassure senior executives and management about the Qlik platform through illustrations of its ease of use and full automation capabilities. </p>
                            <p>This presentation leads up to a full demonstration environment that helps bridge the gap for our non-technical prospects and provides a clear and simple pathway to understand and digest key data points about embedding Qlik Sense in a multi tenant SaaS application platform. A key outcome for using this demonstration asset is to mitigate early in the sales cycle potential risk and at same time build enthusiasm/interest for Qlik Sense, its capabilities and showcase our readiness to support the customer or partner’s vision for embedding analytics within their application suite. </p>
                            <p>This prospect experience is supported by several linked assets including the following: a demo website which simulates the SaaS platform of an OEM partner, aligned to videos and documentation illustrating each integration topic and finally a presentation moving the audience through a journey which highlights key aspects of Qlik Sense, its APIs and the overall value of Qlik.

                <h3 class="ui header">How to use the demo?</h3>
                <p>To put it simply, this demo shows you how you can copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a "template layout" for each of your customers. Next to creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customers database. Because you can insert a custom script you can also specify customer specific data models like "custom fields and tables" or create them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we make a stream per customer and publish the app into this stream. If you would like some guidance please look at our "how to" <a href="#" class="stepByStep">Video</a> or <a href="{{doc_demo_manual}}" class="" target="_blank">"How to" Manual</a>. .

                                In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts.
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The left side shows "the broker" in your SaaS platform; a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker; the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                                </ul>
                                In order to complete the demo you have to follow these steps:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Select customers</b>.In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the customers. By pressing the button you also select an "app" to be used as template for the layout.</li>
                                    <li><b>Press generate</b>, this wil make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It replaces the script with a customer specific one and reloads the app...</li>
                                    <li><b>Select a user and press the green button. This allows you to test the single sing on</b> and make sure that each customer can only sees its own data (streams and apps). You can also test row level security by opening the "row level security" app in the "everyone stream". It demonstrates that each user only sees the values for the country of his group membership.</li>
                                </ol>

                <p>Integrate Qlik Sense in your SaaS automation or provisioning process using our .NET API and Visual Studio plugin. Or you can also use our javascript, websocket and REST based API's to automate each manual activity. Using this mechanism you can for example create/delete/reload apps for each of your customers. You can even create complete dashboards or individual charts on the fly. This removes the need to design everything up front.</p>

                <p>The beauty of Qlik is it allows you choices for your integration. You can choose the level of web integration according to your business requirements. On the client side, you can choose to use our client/front-end or you can create your own. If you use the Qlik Sense client you have the following options.</p>
                <p>You can integrate the hub, an app, a sheet or individual charts. In most cases you have the flexibility to control whether you would like to see our menu, our selection bar or whether or not you would like to provide initial selections or make the charts static so that no selections are possible at all.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Your goal is to create within a multi-tenant SaaS platform environment - embedded analytics - within your core application(s) where each of your customers would see and use only their data. It’s possible for each customer to have a more fine grained authorization structure. </p>
                        <p>As an example, it is possible to provide authorizations for a specific department or country within a dashboard. Ultimately you will see a simple solution in our demonstration in which both of our fictitious users, Peter and John, go to the same website, but see different things based on their authorizations. Qlik Sense makes this possible because it uses a dynamic attribute-based security approach in which we re-use all the pre-existing users and roles from your SaaS platform. This ensures Qlik Sense stays automatically in synch and avoids the overhead of double maintenance.

                <h4 class="ui header">Authentication - Single Sign on</h4> We re-use your existing way to authenticate the users. We will insert a little piece of code inside your existing "security module". In this module you already know who the user is (authentication) and what his rights are (authorization). The only thing we need to do is create a trust relationship between your server and the new Qlik Sense server (via a SSL certificate exchange). And send this info about the user (userId, group membership) in a JSON object to Sense (we call this ticketing).
                <h4 class="ui header">Authorization</h4> Based on the userId and group membership streams (a way to group apps, like HR/Finance), apps, sheets (all called "resources" in our rule based security model) are shown or not. Let's say we start simple and each customer can only view their own dashboards. Since we gave each customer its own stream we can grant access if the name of the stream (your company name) equals the the name of the company we received from your website in the ticket. We can all control this by adding 1 row of security configuraton: User.group = Stream.name.
