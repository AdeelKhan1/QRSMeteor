Please watch this <a href="#" class="howDoesSaaSAutomationWork">video</a> for a quick introduction to the concept of SaaS automation or the video's below for an general introduction. </p>

                                In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts.</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li> The left side shows "the broker" in your SaaS platform; a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).
                                </li>
                                <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker; the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> This demo guides you on how you can automate each manual step in Qlik Sense. Sense works internally with the same API's as you can use, so you can record the REST call from each manual activity in the QMC and use this code to create/delete/reload/publish streams and apps in your software. We will not cover all the use cases, lets say we cover 80%, but the examples and code provided should give you enough convidence to build the remaining 20% yourself.</p>

                    <p> You can watch the step by step video <a href="#" class="stepByStep">here</a>. This demo shows you how you can copy an app (dashboard) for each of your customers. Next to creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customers database (by replacing the SQL based load script). Because you can insert a custom script you can also specify customer specific data models like "custom fields and tables". In the end we make a stream (a way of grouping apps) per customer and publish the app into this stream. The demo consists of 4 steps.
