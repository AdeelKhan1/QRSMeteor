            Created by Martijn Biesbroek & Raymond Neves. QVF design by Patrick Tehubijuluw. This is an open source demo site (not an official Qlik product and as such not supported by Qlik). The only purpose is to give you an idea how powerful the APIs are and to give you a starting template with the source code, instruction videos and documentation. The APIs used are all standard Qlik Sense 3.0 APIs. And the <a href="http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/3.0/Content/Home-developer.htm">APIs</a> themselves are supported by Qlik. The API's used in this demo are just REST and websocket endpoints to which this demo platform <a href="{{pathFor 'APILogs'}}" class="item">communicates</a>. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/QHose/QRSMeteor">github</a> using the The MIT License (MIT) and explained <a href="{{doc_sourceCode}}"> here </a>.
