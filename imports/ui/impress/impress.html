        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheets. It adds all of the styles it needs for the
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation z steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.
        
        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?
        
        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
    
    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
    be removed.
    
    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation z step. More details about
    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.

        The `id` attribute of the z step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `z step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        
        So in the example below it'll be `z step-2`.
        
        The hash part of the url when this z step is active will be `#/z step-2`.
        
        You can also use `#z step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular z step.
        
        Please note, that while `#/z step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
        Using classic `id`-based links like `#z step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

        This z step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this z step element is
        reached.
        
        At the very beginning of the presentation all z step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.
        
        When the presentation moves to given z step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this z step works - text moves when the z step has `present` class.
        
        Finally when the z step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.
        
        So basically every z step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current z step has the `present` class.

        You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
        So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
        10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.
        
        You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
        as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

        <!--
        
        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation z steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of z step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of z step element; default value is 1
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
    When the presentation z step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active z step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the z step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first z step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
    
    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first z step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.
    
    ...
    
    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
    
    Just sayin' ;)
